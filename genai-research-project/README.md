# Generative AI Research Project

## Overview
This repository contains research materials for the Generative AI Applications assignment. It explores high-impact enterprise use cases, technical challenges, and the vocabulary necessary for a Subject Matter Expert (SME) in the field.

## Repository Contents

### 1. Research Report (`research_report.md`)
A detailed markdown report covering three key GenAI applications:
* **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Focusing on enterprise knowledge retrieval.
* **AI-Assisted Code Generation**: discussing developer velocity and security challenges.
* **Synthetic Data Generation**: covering privacy-safe model training.

### 2. SME Vocabulary (`vocabulary.md`)
A curated dictionary of essential GenAI terms (e.g., *Tokenization*, *Hallucination*, *Embeddings*, *Chunking Strategy*) defined from an engineering perspective.

### 3. Visualization (`vocabulary_graph.png`)
A network graph showing the relationship between the vocabulary terms and the research report.
* **Green Nodes**: Terms explicitly mentioned in the text.
* **Blue Nodes**: Concepts implicitly referenced (e.g., "splitting data" $\rightarrow$ "Chunking Strategy").

### 4. Python Script (`generate_graph.py`)
The custom Python script used to programmatically generate the visualization. It uses `networkx` for graph logic and `matplotlib` for rendering.
